Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</name><pose>Unspecified</pose><truncated>0</truncated><difficult>0</difficult><bndbox><xmin>0</xmin><ymin>0</ymin><xmax>1577</xmax><ymax>782</ymax></bndbox></object></annotation>
